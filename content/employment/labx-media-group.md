  LabX Media Group (LMG) is a worldwide information and marketing company
  focused within the science community, with various brands underneath ranging
  from E-commerce, social platforms, and editorial systems.


  Mainly focused in the core brand LabX Marketplace, I started out maintaining
  the [Labx Service Site](https://service.labx.com/). The Labx Service Site's
  stack involved *Node*, *Express*, *JQuery*, *Pug*, *GRUNT*, *LESS*, and
  *MSSQL*. I worked on implementing Google Maps API for locating service
  provider's locations from exact longitude - latitude to distance radius's and
  adding a review system from scratch using JQuery on the front end.


  My next main project was to undergo a big project of rebuilding the LabX
  Marketplace utilizing Magento 2 in a headless state and building a store front
  from scratch. The storefront's stack involved *Node*, *Express*, *React*,
  *Pug*, *GULP*, *SASS*. Though the project was not initially scoped to use
  Magento 2 in a headless state, after many difficulties getting the project
  moving from Magento's lacking frontend I was able to create a proof of concept
  outside of work hours and present the alternate route to progress on the
  project and provide a cleaner storefront experience.
