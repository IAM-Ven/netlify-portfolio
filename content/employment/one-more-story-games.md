description: >-
  Working as a junior client programmer in my first non paid work term, I got
  the chance to work with some familiar technology and some unfamiliar.
  Utilizing a MYSQL database using PHP to talk to a flash built client running
  in an internet browser was all familiar despite the use of action script that
  is used for flash. Using existing knowledge of similar object orientated
  programming such as Java to learn quickly to perform tasks.
