  Yes I'm using my own portfolio site that you're currently on as a project and
  you can't stop me. This was something I would start to make, and scrap it from
  being either too ambitious, or not quite finding the right implementation of a
  CMS. I then finally found a good compromise!


  I built this with with React, React-Router-Dom 4, React-Snapshot, Helmet,
  Bootstrap 4, and Netlify-cms. The end goal was to have a snappy server-less
  website with no page loading built in React, and to have a powerful CMS to
  easily keep content updated, and easily retrieve the content!


  I took inspiration from a portfolio theme i found called Gridus and decided to
  recreate it in React and Bootstrap 4 since the theme was built in Bootstrap 3.
