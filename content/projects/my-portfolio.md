  ## TIME TO GET META


  Yes Im using my own portfolio site that you're currently on as a project and
  you can't stop me.


  I built this with with React, React-Router-Dom 4, React-Snapshot, Helmet, and
  Netlify-cms. The end goal was to have a snappy serverless website with no page
  loading built in React, and to have a powerful CMS to easily keep content
  updated, and easily retrieve the content!
