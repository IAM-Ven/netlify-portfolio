  Smaller Bomb is a single page application made with Node, React, and Flex box,
  using the Giant Bomb API to search for videos and render their embedded video
  player.


  The Giant Bomb website underwent a redesign around this time that was at the
  time in it's beta, I liked the look of their new design and have been a fan of
  the site for a long time and decided to play with their API.
