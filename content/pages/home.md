      As a computer programming graduate and years of work experience under my
      belt, I strive to provide clean, reliable solutions while matching design
      patterns in a given project. Mostly focused in building web applications
      using modern libraries like ReactJS, another passion I have is game
      development.

      Whether it's recreating from inspirations, mockups or designing from
      scratch. I love to create simplistic, clean UI, and smooth UX using a

      back at something and say out loud "This is absolute trash!" \*shrug\*
